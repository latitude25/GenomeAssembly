# GenomeAssembly
Final project for Berkeley CS267 parallel computing.
  
1) Build binary:  
	```
	make
	```
  
2) 2 ways of execution  
	a. run with any {filename}.txt file within hw3-datasets/  
		```
		make DATA={filename}.txt run
		```  
	b. run with any {filename}.txt file within hw3-datasets/smaller/  
		```
		make DATA={filename}.txt} runsmall
		```  
  
3) Test the correction  
	a. if run with {filename}.txt within hw3-datasets/  
		```
		make DATA={filename}.txt check
		```  
	b. if run with {filename}.txt within hw3-datasets/smaller  
		```
		make DATA={filename}.txt checksmall
		```
